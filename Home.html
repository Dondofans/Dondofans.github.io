				I am major in Computer Science and I am being graduated this summer. I have been learning a lot of algorithms to perform certain request by writing codes in C/C++, Java, Python and Golang. I always look forward to learn some new computer languages because each language has its uses in different area. I personally like collecting technologies such as VR things. I hope I can join a team which is a development of VR games because I think it's the furture.
